# Decentralized Limitless User eXperiences Initial Offering (DLUXIO)
![Slide 1](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVmkMheznQSX9geEUZ7KtAoYPNGQ9WhF4SNRC7WdGCvZH)

[**dlux.io**](https://dlux.io) is an integrated VR and AR hosting platform using the STEEM social blockchain. dlux is capable of hosting any dApps that can run in browser.

![Slide 2](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSLBvJ7wGsUbAT2n2FCEo1bPAJZaqVrWPgAx9aH7fymZb)

dlux is currently in beta as we add features. dlux is a first of it's kind platform that utilizes the benefits of blockchain to solve the problems of VR content discovery and monetization.

![Slide 3](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVvQ4EK2MtxLoUXhHpAd8HAJ3V7q2eC1fe9CpTHZ1VpMS)

This sale is intended to fund a community driven vote bot that can self-incentivize new features, maintenance and monetarily encourage content creation and engagement without ads. Funds will be held by @dlux-io to establish this upvote bot that can reward new content, our code maintainers and contributors, marketing, and for overhead. The vote bot runs at the direction of the engaged crowd in a transparent and auditable way.

### Distribution
* 5% friends and family, 0.25% buy in cap.
* 20% first uncapped ICO pool | wait weighted
* 40% 128 daily uncapped pools | wait weighted
* 1% Public Art Endowment
* 1% Personal Mobility Endowment
* 1% SMG Community for teaching artist how to use media
* 1% Yensesa West African Community
* 1% Decentralized Science Endowment
* 15% cofounder @disregardfiat
* 15% cofounder @markegiles
   * Cofounders will equally distribute bounties and marketing tokens as individual entities from personal holdings. Remaining DLUXIO held will be delegated at personal discretion to direct resources toward social goods. No more than 500,000 DLUX SMT of personal holding will be sold per calendar year after SMT distribution.

#### [1] Friends and Family
* 5% allocation = 5,000,000 DLUXIO
* Capped round at $500,000
* Individual purchase cap $25,000 / .25%
* Whitelist
***
#### [2] Public ICO
* 20% allocation = 20,000,000 DLUXIO
* Uncapped
* October 1 - October 31
* Wait Weighted __*__
***
#### [3] Daily micro-offerings
* 0.3125% daily allocation x 128 days = 40,000,000 DLUXIO
* Uncapped
* November 1 - March 8
* Wait Weighted __*__
***
##### * Wait Weighted:
![Graph](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qma6dN53rBhkHM8z3W2HciZ2whK2atttUvfh1e5KwdGoiL)
```
WeightedAmount = PurchaseAmount*(Math.sqrt(Math.pow((BHf - BHo), 2)-Math.pow((BHo+BHb), 2)))/2 + 1/2
```
Where `BH` is Blockheight(time), `o` is initial, `f` is final, and `b` Purchase block.

This is meant to encourage early price discovery/participation and discourage late entries per round.

#### Proof of concept and dual marketing campaign
Between September 1 and September 20 2018 an AR contest will be held on STEEM/dlux. People can develop 3d assets, games, art or programs that are *cool* and interesting. They can publish their submissions to #dluxarcontest from which winners recieve 10,000 DLUXIO from @disregardfiat and @markegiles. Our goal is to have all winners in Los Angeles to present their creations live in a gallery. This art show of course is decentralized and with nothing more than a standard printer can be replicated around the world... and users of some programs will be able to interact in real time with others.
Onboard User experience:
Scans QR code that loads a steem wallet key generation tool. They are guided through username selection, and instructed to take screen captures. They may or maynot provide a recovery email address. Then their public key is shown to the Steemian responsible for the local onboard/art installation(recovery email also passed).

Now they can log in with a copied passcode and their username and save their key to their browser. The app then looks for AR markers and displays a vote botton and winning AR art and experience appropriately as they walk thru the gallery.

Steemian experience: sufficiently high rep account posts that a global pop-up is coming to their neighborhood. They advertise however they like(but hopefully we can generate enough press at ICO along with opening here in Los Angeles with social influencers that other people will be looking for the galleries in their neighborhoods) and then they get paid the account creation fee +10% to correctly incentivize account creation with hopefully enough transparent and auditable attention to onboard without "Sybil".


#### Reason's for DLUX SMT
* Better distribute tokens to effect social good
* Content monetization in perpetuity
* DRM
* Gamification and social wellness incentives

Steem has demonstratably started lifting people out of poverty in economicaly depressed areas. dlux wants to show everybody that by giving up the ad model and owning our own public content and media we can distribute information and financial trust to the third world. With a click you can send a share of blockchain rewards to somebody who 3D printed a house in africa or painted a mural in your neighborhood.

##### SMT Whitepaper Abstract
> Steem’s Smart Media Tokens (SMTs) give anyone the power to launch and sell Proof-of Brain tokens, which are tokens distributed by “upvote” and “like”-based algorithms
and can be integrated with websites to align incentives and spur growth, while websites are
empowered to adopt sustainable, currency-centric revenue models. This model has been
tested and continues to be proven by steemit.com, busy.org, chainbb.com, dsound.audio,
dtube.video and other Steem interfaces, which are monetizing content, tokens and media
in a way never before seen.
Several popular token protocols, such as Ethereum’s ERC-20, allow you to create and
launch arbitrary tokens, but no protocol enables content businesses to leverage those tokens
by aligning incentives between users and applications. Due to suboptimal transaction
cost structures that incur fees for basic actions such as voting or posting, misalignment
of interests between meta and core tokens that aren’t built for influencing distributions
based on Proof-of-Brain, private key hierarchies that don’t cater to social versus financial
operations, and slow transaction speeds that are out of sync with real-time websites - none
of these protocols could ever provide an acceptable user experience for content websites,
such as Twitter, Reddit (even subreddits) or The New York Times.
For content websites and tokens, incentive alignment between websites and users comes
from a steady, as well as decentralized and mathematically guaranteed, release of new
tokens, and incentives that must be allocated to the users - including bloggers, vloggers,
commenters and curators. The distribution of new tokens occurs based on stake-weighted
voting to prevent gaming and eliminate the need for a counterparty. Quality user experience
comes from tokens that can be transacted safely (through separate private keys for
distinct sets of actions), without fees, and at real-time speeds.
